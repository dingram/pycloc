pycloc is a Python-based OAuth client, aimed at being straightforward to use, in the same way as cURL.

Basic walkthrough:

 1. Register your application and get a consumer key and secret

 2. Do one of the following:
   a. Include -k $CONSUMER_TOKEN -K $CONSUMER_SECRET in the first call for a
      host (e.g. the request_token call). Pycloc will save them thereafter.

   b. Place them into your ~/.pyclocrc using the hostname of the target API.

      hosts:
        api.example.com:
          consumer-secret: $MY_CONSUMER_SECRET
          consumer-token: $MY_CONSUMER_TOKEN

 3. Obtain your request token:

      pycloc http://api.example.com/oauth/request_token --request-token

 4. This will then give you a requst token and secret, and an authorize URL (based on the request_token URL -- adapt as necessary).

 5. Visit the authorize URL, authorize the application and obtain a verifier.

 6. Obtain your access token:

      pycloc http://api.example.com/oauth/access_token --access-token -V $VERIFIER

 7. Make requests against the API:

      pycloc http://api.example.com/v1/get_data

      pycloc http://api.example.com/v1/post_something -p -a 'foo=bar' -a 'bz=quux'
